# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "In this work we propose a convex optimization approach, based on weighted l1-regularization, for reconstructing sparse wavelet representations. We show our proposed optimiza- tion problem is effective for solving the signal/image inpainting and denoising problems. The wavelet coefficients associated to the functional representation of the object of interest are obtained as the solution to this optimization problem constrained by either subsamples or noisy observations in the case of inpainting or denoising, respectively. We show that by choosing the weights to be the uniform norms of the wavelet functions the support of the recovered vector of coefficients forms a particular kind of index set, a closed tree. This kind of index set is consistent with the behavior of many real-world signals and images and therefore our approach applies to a wide class of signals. Furthermore, we illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed convex optimization problem by providing numerical examples using both orthonormal wavelets and a frame of wavelets. In addition, we provide analysis to show that the sample complexity associated with the weighted l1-regularized problem is smaller than the sample complexity of the l1-regularized problem."
