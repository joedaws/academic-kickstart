# Biography

I am a graduate research assistant in the department of mathematics 
at the University of Tennessee Knoxville working with 
Professor <a href="https://www.csm.ornl.gov/~cgwebster/">Clayton Webster</a>.
My research interests are motivated by finding connections between challenging 
real-world problems and rigorous theory. 
I believe finding solutions rooted in theory leads to precise answers to difficult 
questions and understanding techniques used in practice leads to theoretical insight.
