# Biography

Joseph Daws is a graduate research assistant in the department of mathematics 
at the University of Tennessee Knoxville working with 
Professor <a href="https://www.csm.ornl.gov/~cgwebster/">Clayton Webster</a>. 
Joseph is interested in problems at the intersection of approximation theory, 
inverse problems, image processing, optimization, and machine learning. 
His most recent work is concerned with studying how regularization 
affects the performance of the optimization problems at the heart
of machine learnign and image processing.
