abstract = "We introduce a class of deep neural networks whose architecture is inspired by polynomial approximation and which can be used for function approximation. Deep neural networks have been deployed for solving many challenging tasks. Despite the immense amount of recent research on neural networks choosing a network architecture and initialization for a given problem is difficult. We show that the parameters of our proposed network can be initialized so that it approximates a given polynomial function. If the chosen polynomial is itself an approximation of a function of interest, our network performs at least as well as the polynomial approximation. We then consider training our constructed network and show several examples where the network achieves an approximation better than the polynomial approximation used to initialize its parameters."
